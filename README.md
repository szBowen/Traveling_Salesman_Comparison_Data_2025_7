# Traveling_Salesman_Comparison_Data_2025_7

This repository contains data and results for the comparison of different Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithms. The files are organized and named according to their type and source:

### File Types

1. **Files starting with "tsp"**:
   These files contain the **distance matrices** of various graphs. The distance matrix represents the distances between each pair of nodes in a graph, which are essential for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.

2. **Files starting with "!!resBB-"**:
   These files contain the results of the computations performed by **Melnikov's program**. The number at the end of the file name corresponds to the graph number that the results pertain to.

3. **Files named "result"**:
   These files contain the results of the computations performed by **Leno's program**. Each line in the file corresponds to a specific graph, with the sequence number in the file matching the graph number.

### Structure of the Data
- **tsp files**: Each file represents a specific graph's distance matrix.
- **!!resBB- files**: The results are computed using Melnikov's algorithm, and each file is associated with a specific graph number.
- **result files**: Each line in these files corresponds to the results from Leno's program for a specific graph, with the line number matching the graph number.

Feel free to explore the files for a detailed comparison of the different algorithms applied to TSP.
